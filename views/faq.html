        <h4>I'm confused, how does the game work?</h4>
        <p>The game generates a number between 1 and 100, and allows you to bet on what you think the result will be.</p>
        <p>Your probability of winning, and payout for guessing correctly is proportional to how specific the range
        you bet. The payout of guessing correct is such that the house edge would be 1% or less.</p>
        <p>Some times the house edge is less than one percent because the payout is rounded to two decimal numbers
            the server accepts that bet and adjust the house edge to match it, this is in order to give our users the best user interface and game experience possible.</p>
