                <h4>How the game works?</h4>
                <p>The game generates a number between one and one hundred randomly every game and you bet that the number will be between a range.</p>
                <p>For example if you bet that the result will be between 1 to 49 that mean you have a 48% of winning and your payout is two times your bet.</p>
                <p>As you can see there is 1% missing given that the house edge is 1%, that is used to make a simultaneous bet to win the jackpot of 1BTC, the probability for you to win the bitcoin is: (Your wager/100)/1BTC.<br/>
                This means that if you bet 1BTC you have one in a hundred ods to win the jackpot.
                </p>
                <p>If you bet 100BTC you are warranted to get the 1BTC jackpot.</p>
                <p>If you bet more than 100BTC you are warranted to get 1% of your bet back to ensure the 1% house edge for big bets.</p>
                <p>For the sake of simplicity the only two parameters that you can edit of your bet are the wager and the probability from 1% to 97% in integer units, this let us do a simple and fun interface to bet.</p>


                <h4>What is MoneyPot?</h4>
